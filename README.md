# twitch_emote_api (WIP)
![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/twitch-emote-client)

very overengineered, very cool API to let you find out what awesome third party
emotes your favorite streamer has, and also download every frame of them either
separetely in WebP format or as a texture atlas!

use the heckin [NPM library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitch-emote-client)

<sub>please self host the api, my poor oracle cloud instance can't handle much more.........</sub>

## endpoints
erm read [main.rs](api/src/main.rs) and good luck, for now
