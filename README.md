# twitch_emote_api
very overengineered, very cool API to let you find out what awesome third party
emotes your favorite streamer has, and also download every frame of them separately
in WebP format

## endpoints
erm read [main.rs](api/src/main.rs) and good luck, for now

<sub>*also, it's gonna have a JS library thingy which is gonna be cool and awesome*</sub>
